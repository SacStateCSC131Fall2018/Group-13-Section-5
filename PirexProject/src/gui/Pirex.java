/**
 * The Pirex is an information retrieval system that individuals can use 
 * to investigate their own texts. This program uses the PirexWindow class 
 * to create a graphic user interface and declares a PirexWindow data type 
 * named window and then constructs window as a new PirexWindow from 
 * PirexWindow.java. which extends JFrame. In Sprint 1, we need to ensure 
 * that we meet the needs of the stake holders and present a valid and 
 * click-able GUI. 
 * 
 * @note for Grader:
 * The first commit for this project can be found here: https://github.com/JLibbon/CSC-131-Group
 * We did not know that the professor shared a repository with us when we 
 * first committed a version to github.
